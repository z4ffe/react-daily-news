      "content": "Virtual reality is for checking out. The wider the field of vision and the less light peeking in, the better. But as VR becomes more mainstream, there needs to be a way to quickly check back in with reality. A safe word, so to speak, to pull you out of VR, whether you’re feeling overwhelmed by a game or if you want to feel more present.\n\nThat’s exactly what the passthrough button offers on Meta’s Quest and Quest 2. It’s both a safety tool, as well as a practical one to let you see what’s going on outside of the headset without having to struggle to take it off. After firmly double-tapping either side of the headset where the straps attach to it, a view of your room — albeit a pixelated, monochromatic feed as seen through a handful of low-megapixel cameras — will show up on the display.\n\nThis button eliminates the need to take off the VR headset for minor interruptions. It’s there for those times when you need to gather yourself when someone’s calling for you across the room or if you want to grab a snack on your desk without making a mess. It gets bonus points for making you look futuristic while you tap your headset.\n\nA safe word, so to speak, to pull you out of VR\n\nBut critically, this button is invisible — it’s not a physical button, just a specific spot on the headset waiting for a gesture. An invisible button risks being overlooked, and the opaqueness of activating passthrough mode could bury it out of sight for some users. That intention is important, though: being yanked out of an immersive VR session because of a misfired gesture or button press would not be ideal. Meta goes so far as to require you to manually enable the button. You have to flip a switch within the settings, where it’s positioned as a safety tool to make sure you aren’t about to endanger yourself (or others). \n\nRelated\nThese features make the Meta Quest 2 even better\nYes, it’s weird for the two-year-old Meta Quest 2 to go up in price\n\nIn this section of the video, I demonstrate passthrough mode\n\nEven using the gesture to then turn it on requires deliberation. You’ve got to feel for the part of the head strap that connects to the headset, then make two quick and firm taps. Not the gentle “touching your smartphone” taps, but almost like you’re trying to awaken a creature in the headset to perform its job.\n\nI would have enjoyed being a fly on the wall in the meeting at Meta, where someone won the argument that made it so the Quest 2 had this invisible button instead of a hardware button. Perhaps it was contentious. On one hand, if you’re selling something that dissolves the connection with reality (and can lead to injury or extensive property damage in inexperienced hands), a real, tactile button sounds like a good idea. But not everyone — especially early adopters of VR or experienced users — wants or needs that hand-holding. Having fewer buttons (just a power button and a volume rocker) makes the Quest 2 easier to learn how to use. What we got was a compromise, but importantly, it’s one that better lets the feature melt away when you don’t need it.\n\nThe Meta Quest 2 sits in a dark room, lit by some purple and blue effect light.\nIt’s a great button because it is only there when you need it. Photo by Owen Grove / The Verge\nAs cool as the passthrough button is for keeping you safe or letting you take a swig of a drink on your table, the feature itself could use some work. The piped-through reality isn’t easy on the eyes; it’s displayed in a single hue, overblows light sources, and often warps the view of reality in strange ways. I can forgive that since it’s not meant to be used for longer than quick bursts. For passthrough enthusiasts who obsess over quality (they exist!), Meta’s new $1,500 Quest Pro improves on that fidelity with a colorized feed, as well as a higher-quality picture. But while the Quest 2 allows no peripheral version — making a better case for passthrough mode —Meta took a different tact with the Quest Pro, keeping your peripheral vision so that passthrough mode isn’t necessary to see what’s on your desk or that someone’s coming your way.\n\nLike 3D Touch or the programmable tap-on-back features in some newer phones, most people may not know that this secretive gesture-meets-button is just two taps away. But this quick shortcut that puts me in control of whether I’m seeing a virtual reality or my reality makes it one of my favorite things about the Quest 2."

Though we may never know what might have come from a sequel to that 2009 film, Bryan Fuller has an idea or two about what Jason Voorhees has been up to in the distant past that’s set to be explored in a new “expanded prequel” series for Peacock.\n\nPeacock announced today that Fuller has signed on to write, showrun, and executive produce Crystal Lake, a new Friday the 13th series from A24.\n\nIn a press release about the new show, Fuller reminisced about how he first became familiar with the Friday the 13th franchise as a kid while reading an issue of Famous Monsters magazine and expressed his excitement at the idea of working together with NBCUniversal Television and Streaming chair Susan Rovner again.\n\n“When it comes to horror, A24 raises the bar and pushes the envelope and I’m thrilled to be exploring the camp grounds of Crystal Lake under their banner,” Fuller said. “And Susan Rovner is simply the best at what she does. It’s a pleasure and an honor to be working with her again.”\n\nPeacock also announced that Marc Toberoff, Victor Miller, and Robert Barsamian are set to executive produce alongside Fuller, but details about Crystal Lake, like its story, cast, and a potential release date, are currently being kept quiet."

The acquisition means that Spry Fox will become Netflix’s sixth in-house gaming studio.\n\nFor Spry Fox, the acquisition won’t mean any changes for now. The studio’s current games will remain available for download “in their current forms on their current platforms,” co-founder and CEO David Edery said in a post on Spry Fox’s blog, and the studio is already working on making Cozy Grove 2 and “a larger, non-violent MMO.” Thanks to the acquisition, “we can stop stressing about how our games generate profit on our games and instead focus exclusively on making them as enjoyable and fulfilling to our players as possible,” Edery said.\n\nSpry Fox will join a roster of Netflix studios that includes Helsinki-based Next Games, mobile studio Boss Fight Entertainment, Oxenfree developer Night School, and internal studios in Finland and in Southern California.\n\nNetflix officially launched its mobile games offering nearly one year ago, letting subscribers play a collection of Android and iOS titles for no additional charge. As part of its earnings announcement this month, Netflix said its collection has 35 titles available for subscribers and that there are 55 more games in development. While data indicates that most subscribers haven’t tried the games yet, Netflix’s commitment to more games, its acquisitions of studios like Spry Fox, and vocal interest in cloud gaming all suggest that the company is taking gaming seriously."

      "content": "Elon Musk is looking into the Twitter archives for ways to improve his newly acquired social network. His team has told engineers at the company to look at Vine’s code to figure out how much work it would take to revive it, according to a current employee who spoke to The Verge on the condition of anonymity, as they’re not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.\n\nAxios first reported the news, saying that the reboot could be ready by the end of the year. That’s an aggressive timeframe to revive a five-year-old app, especially given this tweet from former Twitter product director Sara Beykpour that some of Vine’s code is over 10 years old. But that seems to be a pattern with Musk; this weekend, Twitter employees were told they’d have until November 7th to implement a program that would force a monthly fee for blue checkmarks or they’d be fired.\n\n\nOn Sunday, Musk tweeted a poll asking if he should bring back Vine. When Twitter was a public company, it purchased the six-second looping video service in 2012, before its launch in 2013. As of Monday afternoon, “yes” was winning, with around 69 percent of over 4 million votes. (I’m certain the Chief Twit is very pleased by that number.)\n\nGiven that we’re just a few days after Musk completed his $44 billion purchase and fired the board and other executives, the situation at the company is very fluid. The Vine source code probe could be as much about testing out engineers as it is about actually reviving the service; though Musk has denied reports that he wants to fire 75 percent of Twitter’s employees, it does still seem like there are plans for layoffs at the company.\n\nIf Vine does come back, it’ll exist in a very different world than it did in the early to mid-2010s. For one, TikTok is a thing, and it feels like every other social media company has copied its model of short, looping videos. Musk has already started crowdsourcing information on how to compete with the platform, though, and Twitter could always take a different approach; Vine could become part of Twitter itself instead of a separate app like it was originally, or it could have some unique catch that makes it stand out.\n\nBut those sorts of details are putting the cart way before the horse. For now, all we know is that Musk is considering it, along with several other changes at Twitter that may or may not come to pass. Still, for those Vine diehards out there (a group that includes me), it could be a faint glimmer of hope that we could once again be doing it for the Vine."

      "content": "The way Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’s Talocan bears little resemblance to the Atlantis of Marvel’s comic books is one of the most intriguing things about the movie and its central villain: the sea-dwelling antiheroic King Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta. Namor’s short shorts, winged feet, and intense hatred of the surface world are all still important parts of his character that Wakanda Forever spotlights with a tale about how he’s moved to lead Talocan to war.\n\nBut what Huerta was most moved by as he stepped up to the challenge of bringing Namor to the MCU is how Wakanda Forever’s story and its conceptualization of Talocan are celebrations of Latin American identity with a distinct focus on its shared Indigenous and African roots.\n\nUnlike the Namor of Marvel’s comics who reigns over a very standard version of Atlantis (an advanced society sunken by a great calamity), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’s Namor hails from Talocan, an underwater nation inspired by the Tlālōcān of Aztec mythology. Talocan — like Wakanda — is a fictional place meant to reflect a number of different cultural influences, and Huerta sees it as a concept perfect for helping people to better understand the Indigenous and African contributions to Latin American history — Mexico’s in particular.\n\nA group of Talokanil.\nA group of Talokanil. Image: Marvel Studios\nSpeaking during the recent Black Panther: Wakanda Forever press junket, Huerta described how while “almost everybody in Mexico has Indigenous or African roots,” people often like to deny those aspects of their heritage, something the 41-year-old actor sees as needing more discussion.\n\n“Culturally, we are apart from [our] Indigenous roots,” Huerta said. “Embracing those roots, and honoring these two sources — main sources in Latin America, which [are] African and Indigenous roots — is really important. I hope this helps people to embrace who they are. Who we are.”\n\nIn addition to drawing inspiration from a variety of Mesoamerican cultures, Wakanda Forever’s story establishes its own interesting mythology that ties Talocan and Wakanda’s histories together. While those ideas serve a specific narrative function within the context of the film, Huerta said that he hopes theatergoers understand and internalize them as testaments to a cultural richness deserving of respect and recognition.\n\n“They taught us to be ashamed of who we are, but it’s time to cut [that shame] off and say, ‘Yeah, this is who I am; I never had anything wrong with me,’” Huerta said. “The mistake was in the eyes that were looking at us — that were judging us. Most of the time, it was ourselves. It’s time to change the glasses and now reconcile who we are with our ancestors — with our old, old grandparents — and embrace them."

As of publication, Tritium has sold 7,600 chargers worldwide, according to data provided on its website. Recently, Tritium secured a deal to provide chargers to over 100 Taco Bell locations.\n\nThough the DC-America and Tritium deal doesn’t specify how many of its federally-funded stations are in the works, the US is sorely in need of more charging stations. Last month, the Biden administration approved $900 million in funding to 35 states to build out EV chargers, part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that’s secured about $5 billion and is distributing $1 billion of it per year until 2026.\n\nToday, there are only about 5,000 non-Tesla DC fast charging stations in the US, hosting a mix of about 10,600 connectors of the widely standardized CCS Combo connector and the (largely) Nissan Leaf-only CHAdeMO port. Electrify America owns one of the larger coast-to-coast networks that consists of more than 800 stations — some including faster 350kW charging speeds that are way ahead of what Tritium is using for this project."
